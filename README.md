Poker hand evaluator tool


Poker hand evaluator
We would like you to build a software tool that can evaluate a poker hand. Your tool should allow a user to submit 5 cards and receive an answer that tells them the highest rank that can be obtained using those 5 cards.
For example:
• Ace of Spades
• 10 of Clubs
• 10 of Hearts,
• 3 of Diamonds
• 3 of Spades
Should return Two pairs.
You can find out more about poker hand ranks here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands
Your tool must:
• be easy for a user to use, without special knowledge of your tool;
• be written in a way that allows other developers to easily modify or extend your code;
• be testable;
• handle errors gracefully;
• contain your Git commit history; and,
• run on a standard laptop without requiring specific knowledge of your tool and software to install (we’ll make sure the laptop is running the correct languages but you’ll need to tell us how to run it).
You can:
• use any programming language (but ideally pick from Python, PHP, Javascript, Java or C#/++);
• use any programming design pattern or method;
• use existing tools or APIs to classify and evaluate your hands, or build your own tools to do so without using third party software or services; or a mixture of both approaches;
• create a front-end to handle input, or use the command line;
• expose your tool via an API; and,
• explain your thinking using comments in your code.



You don’t need to
• build every feature
• write evaluations for every hand rank (but pick at least 5 ranks to evaluate against);
• compare your hand to another one; or,
• determine a winner.
We are looking for:
• how you prioritise features (you don’t need to implement everything);
• how you structure your code;
• good evidence of:
o object oriented programming;
o design principles;
o separation of concerns;
o testing methodologies; and,
• how your code progresses (this is why a Git history is important).
Please submit your code as a ZIP archive, or a Github link, containing your code and any instructions we need to run it.
This isn’t a simple assessment and is likely to take some time and we are aware that you have other priorities so feel free to mock out or explain any of the features you’d like to develop/include to but don’t have time to but please make sure any features you do build run.
If you have any questions regarding the assessment please get in touch.
Goodluck!
