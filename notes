From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Five playing cards – the ace, king, queen, jack and ten of hearts – spread out in a fan.
An ace-high straight flush, commonly known as a royal flush, is the best possible hand in many variants of poker.

In poker, players form sets of five playing cards, called hands, according to the rules of the game.
[1] 
Each hand has a rank, which is compared against the ranks of other hands participating in the showdown to decide who wins the pot.
[2] 
In high games, like Texas hold 'em and seven-card stud, the highest-ranking hands win. In low games, like razz, the lowest-ranking hands win. 
In high-low split games, both the highest-ranking and lowest-ranking hands win, though different rules are used to rank the high and low hands.
[3][4]

Each hand belongs to a category determined by the patterns formed by its cards. 
A hand in a higher-ranking category always ranks higher than a hand in a lower-ranking category. 
A hand is ranked within its category using the ranks of its cards. 
Individual cards are ranked, from highest to lowest: 
A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2.

[5] 
However, aces have the lowest rank under ace-to-five low or ace-to-six low rules, 
or under high rules as part of a five-high straight or straight flush.
[6][7] 
Suits are not ranked, so hands that differ by suit alone are of equal rank.
[8]

There are nine categories of hand when using a standard 52-card deck, 
except under ace-to-five low rules where straights, 
flushes and straight flushes are not recognized. 
An additional category, five of a kind, exists when using one or more wild cards. 
The fewer hands a category contains, the higher its rank.
[9] 

There are 52 ! ( 52 − 5 ) ! = 311 , 875 , 200 
{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {52!}{(52-5)!}}=311,875,200\end{matrix}}} 
{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {52!}{(52-5)!}}=311,875,200\end{matrix}}} 
ways to deal five cards from the deck but only 52 ! ( 52 − 5 ) ! 5 ! = 2 , 598 , 960 
{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {52!}{(52-5)!5!}}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}} 
{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {52!}{(52-5)!5!}}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}} 
distinct hands, because the order in which cards are dealt or arranged in a hand does not matter.

[10] Moreover, since hands differing only by suit are of equal rank, there are only 7,462 distinct hand ranks.[11]
